# luiseugenio/shortenerofluis

## Description

An application developed in Ruby. It accomplishes URL shortening and redirection from shortened URLs. With shortest possible length.

## Requirements

This template currently works with:

* Ruby 2.6.0
* Rails 5.2.3
* Sidekiq
* PostgreSQL

## Usage

Project details

1. Strategy:
    1. Take the ID in the database of the URL and then convert it to either Base 36 [a-z0-9] (case insensitive) to generate shortened URL;
    2. I used ActiveJob to perform the title search in the background;
    3. I used gem Faker to populate the database for the Top 100 board;
    4. Performed Model, Request and Acceptance tests.
2. Repository: https://github.com/luiseugenio/shortenerofluis
3. Production server on Heroku:
    1. Host: https://vast-thicket-11159.herokuapp.com/
    2. Configuration File: Procfile

To execute in development mode:

```
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
rspec spec
cucumber
rails s
```

To promote in production mode:

```
git push heroku master
```

* The database supported by this app is `postgresql`.

## What does it do?

The app will perform this actions:

1. Index
```
get https://vast-thicket-11159.herokuapp.com/
```

2. Generate Short URLs
```
get https://vast-thicket-11159.herokuapp.com/short_urls/new
```

3. Un-Short Shortened URLs
```
get https://vast-thicket-11159.herokuapp.com/:shortened_url
```

4. Show TOP 100 most visit links
```
https://vast-thicket-11159.herokuapp.com/short_urls/top_100
